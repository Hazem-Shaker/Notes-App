# Notes App

A simple web application that allows users to create, edit, and manage notes. This project leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a seamless user experience for note-taking.

## Features

- **Create Notes:** Easily create new notes with a title and body.
- **Edit Notes:** Update existing notes, and changes are saved automatically.
- **Remove Notes:** Delete notes that are no longer needed.
- **Search and Filter:** Search through notes by title and filter notes by creation date, last edited date, or alphabetically.
